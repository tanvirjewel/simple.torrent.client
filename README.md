# simple.torrent.client
A simple Torrent client App using  YTFY API , .net core and Angular-4.
# This is a .NET core Application with Angular 4
#To Run this Project u must have nodejs , visual studio 2017 with .NET core 2.0 installed on tour Machine



# In this Application, I didn't use any .NET core Feature. I could open a simple Angular Project.But i Did use .NET Core sample app because 
its easy to open a project and Visual studio will download all Dependency. Makes Life easy :)


SO, Enjoy the App !!!
